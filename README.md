<summary><h3>👨‍💻 Xros3x's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I started my coding journey on a differnet path than i'm taking now, what I mean by that is at first I wanted to get into tech and tried the cyber secuirty route which was fun and interesting, but there was a feeling that was missing while learning it. Although it took me an year to find that feeling that was missing I came across the python language while learning one of the course I was taking. When I came across the langauge I was so interested in it which made me research it more and saw that I could build tools with it. From there I started practicing what I was learning from the language. Fast forward 5 months after discovering python I wanted to see what careers there were for the passion I discovered for coding. Later I saw and researched the role "BackEnd Developer". It amazed me that the career i've been looking for existed and how I didn't mind staying up every night to gain the skills for my dream role, but the down part is i'm still on the journey to land that role. I won't give up and will land that role no matter if it requires an new language I will dedicate my time to fulfill what the role needs.
